## Chapter 1: Introduction to transformers ✔️
introduced pipeline structure and basic information about transformers and about huggingface 

## Chapter 2: Text classification with transformers ✔️
used 🤗 accelerate library for training distilbert 
and 🤗 dataset library for getting dataset from internet 
typical training 
> main takeaways: 
1. dataset.map(tokenizer_map_fn) # this will map toeknizer to trianing text ( there will be collate_fn for this in future chapter) 
2. AutoTokenizer and AutoModel class for usign models 
3. load_datset function for loading various types of dataset to the dataset object.
